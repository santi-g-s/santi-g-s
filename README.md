### Hey, I'm Santiago ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a student at The University of Pennsylvania's Jerome Fisher Program in Management and Technology (M&T)! 
I'm pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science from the School of Engineering and B.S. in Economics from Wharton.

I am passionate about the intersection of business and engineering and its capacity to solve the issues facing people today - from tackling the causes of climate change, to empowering people with the technology they need to better their lives. 
I am driven by a curiosity of how exisiting breakthroughs can be applied towards solutions in the world around us.

Currently, my focus is on iOS developement, with highlighted proficiency in SwiftUI and UIKit. You can find my apps here: [App Store Portfolio](https://apps.apple.com/gb/developer/santiago-garcia-santos/id1555327973). 

You can also read some of my work on my [Medium](https://medium.com/@santiagogarciasantos). 

I am also working on UI design and webdev at [Hack4Impact](https://github.com/hack4impact-upenn).
